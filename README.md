daveudaimon-sf2-bundles
=======================

These are utility bundles that I use in all my sf2 projects. Feel free to use and improve.

ImageManagerBundle
------------------

SF2 service to handle image upload and display, with on demand thumbnail generation and automatic on disk caching.

VisitorTrackingBundle
-------------

Track your visitors step by step, analyse and take action !

UserTrackingBundle
-------------

Track your users step by step, analyse and take action !

XsltBundle
----------

Xslt is great, handling xslt on disk is a hassle. Hopefully less with this bundle.

UtilsBundle
-----------

A bunch of things I don't want do rewrite for each project but not big enough to make a bundle of their own.
